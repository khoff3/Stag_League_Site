Data Join Example: Raw Player Scores + Playoff Schedule

This script demonstrates how to join the raw player scores (from validation)
with the playoff-annotated schedule data for comprehensive analysis.

Key Concepts:
1. Raw player data: data/raw/{season}/week_{week}/team_{id}.json
2. Annotated schedule: data/processed/schedule/{season}/schedule_annotated.csv
3. Join keys: season, week, team_id
4. Validation: Compare reconstructed vs. schedule scores
