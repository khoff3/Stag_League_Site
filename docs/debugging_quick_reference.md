# Debugging Quick Reference

## üö® Critical Issues Checklist

Before running any season pipeline, verify these 4 critical components:

### 1. Team Sorting Logic ‚úÖ
```bash
# Check if teams are sorted correctly by win percentage
python -c "
from src.ingest.nfl.schedule import NFLScheduleIngest
ingest = NFLScheduleIngest()
# Should show teams 1-6, 7-8, 9-12 in correct order
"
```

### 2. Playoff Bracket Assignment ‚úÖ
```bash
# Generate playoff brackets
python -c "from src.ingest.nfl.schedule import NFLScheduleIngest; ingest = NFLScheduleIngest(); ingest.save_playoff_brackets(2021)"

# Verify middle_teams section
cat data/processed/schedule/2021/playoff_brackets.json | grep -A 10 '"middle_teams"'
```

### 3. Mediocre Bowl Games Injection ‚úÖ
```bash
# Should show "Seed 7:" and "Seed 8:" (NOT "7th place:")
python -c "from src.ingest.nfl.schedule import NFLScheduleIngest; ingest = NFLScheduleIngest(); ingest.inject_mediocre_bowl_games(2021)"
```

### 4. Playoff Annotation ‚úÖ
```bash
# Should show "Mediocre Bowl: 4 games" for 2018+
python src/scripts/playoff_annotator_fixed.py --season 2021
```

## üîß Common Fixes

### Wrong Teams in Middle Bracket
**Problem**: Middle teams show wrong teams (e.g., Chubb Scouts instead of SLamb Dunkin')
**Solution**: 
1. Check sorting logic in `_get_playoff_teams`
2. Verify playoff bracket generation uses `middle_teams` from `_get_playoff_teams`
3. Regenerate playoff brackets completely

### No Mediocre Bowl Games Found
**Problem**: Playoff annotation shows "Mediocre Bowl: 0 games"
**Solution**:
1. Verify mediocre bowl games injection uses playoff bracket teams
2. Check that `inject_mediocre_bowl_games` reads from `playoff_brackets.json`
3. Run playoff annotation after injecting games

### Wrong Sorting Order
**Problem**: Teams appear in wrong order in playoff brackets
**Solution**:
1. Check sorting criteria in `_get_playoff_teams`
2. Ensure win percentage is primary key, points for is tiebreaker
3. Verify sorting function handles ties correctly

## üéØ Expected Results for 2018+

### Team Assignments
- **Winners Bracket**: Teams 1-6 (top 6 by win percentage)
- **Middle Teams**: Teams 7-8 (seeds 7-8 for mediocre bowl)
- **Consolation**: Teams 9-12 (seeds 9-12 for toilet bowl)

### Playoff Annotation Summary
```
playoff_rounds:
  Toilet Bowl: 4 games
  Mediocre Bowl: 4 games
  Third Place: 3 games
  Winners Round 1: 2 games
  Championship: 1 games
```

### File Contents
- `playoff_brackets.json`: Should have `middle_teams` section with correct teams
- `mediocre_bowl_standings.json`: Should have 2 teams with 3-week totals
- `schedule_annotated.csv`: Should have `playoff_round_name` column with "Mediocre Bowl" entries

## üöÄ Complete Validation Pipeline

```bash
# Run this sequence to validate a season completely
SEASON=2021

echo "=== VALIDATING $SEASON ==="

# 1. Generate playoff brackets
python -c "from src.ingest.nfl.schedule import NFLScheduleIngest; ingest = NFLScheduleIngest(); ingest.save_playoff_brackets($SEASON)"

# 2. Inject mediocre bowl games
python -c "from src.ingest.nfl.schedule import NFLScheduleIngest; ingest = NFLScheduleIngest(); ingest.inject_mediocre_bowl_games($SEASON)"

# 3. Run playoff annotation
python src/scripts/playoff_annotator_fixed.py --season $SEASON

# 4. Generate all standings
python -c "from src.ingest.nfl.schedule import NFLScheduleIngest; ingest = NFLScheduleIngest(); ingest.save_all_standings($SEASON)"

# 5. Verify results
echo "=== VERIFICATION ==="
echo "Mediocre bowl teams:"
cat data/processed/schedule/$SEASON/playoff_brackets.json | jq '.middle_teams[].team_name'
echo ""
echo "Mediocre bowl standings:"
cat data/processed/schedule/$SEASON/mediocre_bowl_standings.json | jq '.[].team_name'
```

## üìù Debugging Tips

1. **Start with sorting** - If sorting is wrong, everything downstream breaks
2. **Check playoff brackets first** - Verify `middle_teams` section is correct
3. **Use 2021 as reference** - We've debugged it thoroughly, use it as a baseline
4. **Add debug prints** - Temporary debug output helps identify issues quickly
5. **Regenerate completely** - Sometimes deleting and regenerating files fixes caching issues
6. **Check file timestamps** - Ensure you're looking at the most recent version of files

## üêõ Common Error Messages

- `"No mediocre bowl games found"` ‚Üí Mediocre bowl games not injected or wrong teams
- `"Not enough middle teams"` ‚Üí Playoff brackets missing middle_teams section
- `"No playoff brackets found"` ‚Üí Run `save_playoff_brackets` first
- Wrong team names in output ‚Üí Check sorting logic and team assignments
