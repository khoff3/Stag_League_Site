### Detailed Task Breakdown – Phase 1C (NFL Scraper Optimization) ✅

| Task ID | Description | Est. hrs | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **1C-1** | Refactor single large class into modular components | 4 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1C-2** | Add configuration management and error handling | 3 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1C-3** | Implement concurrent scraping with ThreadPoolExecutor | 2 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1C-4** | Add driver reuse and team ID caching | 2 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1C-5** | Optimize wait times (3s → 1s → 0.5s) | 1 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1C-6** | Performance testing and validation | 2 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |

> **Definition of done:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - 12 teams scraped in 6.36s concurrent, 146 players extracted consistently

### Detailed Task Breakdown – Phase 1A (NFL ingest) ✅

| Task ID | Description | Est. hrs | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **1A-1** | Write `schedule.py` (hit scoreboard endpoint, cache) | 2 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1A-2** | Parse roster blocks into team-week rows | 3 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1A-3** | Pull player stats per week, dedupe with disk cache | 4 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| **1A-4** | PyTest fixtures + "row-count sanity" test | 2 | ✅ **COMPLETED** |

> **Definition of done:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - 2011 Week 1 rows exist in `fact_team_week` & `fact_player_week` and match site totals within ±0.1 pts.

## Risk & Mitigation Log

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| NFL unofficial endpoints change or disappear | 🟥 | ✅ **MITIGATED** - Optimized HTML scraper with 0.5s wait times, multiple fallback methods |
| Player-ID mismatches between sites | 🟧 | Maintain `bridge_player_ids.csv`; manual overrides allowed |
| Auction logic edge-cases | 🟨 | Write unit tests with 2021-24 drafts covering min/max price |
| Dynamic JS content blocking scraping | 🟥 | ✅ **MITIGATED** - Explicit element waiting + optimized wait times |

## Performance Achievements

### NFL Scraper v2 (Current)
- **Concurrent scraping**: 6.36s for 12 teams (5.8x faster than original)
- **Sequential scraping**: 8.76s for 12 teams (1.4x faster than original)
- **Data quality**: 146+ players extracted consistently per week
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate with robust error handling

## Glossary

* **Bronze → Silver pattern** – raw ➜ cleaned/parquet ➜ analytical DB.  
* **Idempotent ingest** – Rerunning a job never duplicates rows or overwrites cache unless `--force` flag.  
* **Sleeper ID** – canonical primary key in `dim_player`.
* **Optimized scraping** – Concurrent execution with driver reuse and 0.5s wait times.
